# The Difficulty of Novelty Detection and Adaptation in Physical Environments

## Abstract

Detecting and adapting to novel situations is a major challenge for AI systems that operate in open-world environments. One reason for this challenge is due to the diverse range of forms that novelties can take. To accurately evaluate an AI systemâ€™s ability to detect and adapt to novelties, it is crucial to investigate and formalize the difficulty of different novelty types. In this paper, we propose a method for quantifying the difficulty of novelty detection and novelty adaptation in open-world physical environments, considering factors such as the appearance and location of objects, as well as the actions required by the agent. We implement several difficulty measures using a combination of qualitative spatial relations, learning algorithms, and statistical distance measures. To demonstrate an application of our approach, we apply our difficulty measures to novelties in the popular physics simulation game Angry Birds. We invite researchers to incorporate the proposed novelty difficulty measures when evaluating AI systems to gain a better understanding of their limitations and identify areas for future improvement.
